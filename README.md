# RECOMMEND-ME-RAILS
##Description:
This application was created in order to organize and share recommendations among a groups of individuals.  A user account can be created with a name, email and password, or by logging in with a Google account (and using OmniAuth verification).  A user can log in at any time with their email and password, or once again through their Google account.  Once logged in, a user is able to see a listing of all the current recommendations, sorted by category.  A user may create new recommendations, and view details on existing recommendations (including other user's comments).  Recommendations may also be viewed limited to specific categories, or by the recommender.  Recommendations may only be edited or deleted by the user that created the recommendation.  Users may also comment on recommendations, which similarly, may only be edited or deleted by the user that generated the comment.

##Install Instructions:
To use this app, just clone it from GitHub, run 'bundle install', and 'rake db:migrate'. Then launch it by entering "thin start --ssl" in your terminal.  This is necessary to provide a secure connection which will allow the OmniAuth signin option to work.  From there direct your browser to "https://localhost:3000/".  The browser will likely be concerned that the connection is not private, so you will then need to choose the "ADVANCED" link (in Google Chrome) and then select "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" to view the app.
